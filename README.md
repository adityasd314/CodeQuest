==================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains my solutions for CodeQuest 4.0, the annual coding competition organized by CSI COEP Tech Student Chapter. I am thrilled to announce that I secured the First Place and earned the title of Coding Champion for the Academic Year 23-24.

Rules
-----

-   All solutions were coded directly on the platform(Hackerrank), supporting over 30 languages.
-   Certificates of Participation will be provided to all participants who submitted at least one question.
-   Strict plagiarism checks were conducted. Participants with very similar submissions lost all points for the problematic question.
-   Cheating was strictly prohibited. Participants found cheating were given a warning for the first instance, and subsequent violations led to disqualification.

Scoring
-------

-   Each challenge had a pre-determined score.
-   Participants were ranked based on the number of test cases their code successfully passed.
-   In case of a tie, the total time taken to submit the last solution was considered for breaking the tie.

Repository Structure
--------------------

-   Each problem solution is organized into separate directories.
-   The code files are named appropriately, and a brief description of each problem is provided.
-   Please note that sharing code is against the competition rules, and these solutions are shared solely for educational purposes.
